# Project Title

Shipment Pricing Prediction

# Project Difficulty level

Intermediate

# Problem Statement:

The logistics industry is a significant contributor to the global economy, facilitating the movement of goods and services across the world. The pricing of shipments is a crucial factor for businesses and individuals, as it can significantly impact their bottom line. Accurate prediction of shipment prices is essential for companies to manage their budgets and optimize their pricing strategies. In this project, we aimed to develop a machine-learning model that can predict shipment prices based on various factors such as distance, transportation mode, package weight, and dimensions.

# Main Goal:

The main goal is to predict the shipment pricing based on the available
features in the dataset.

# Approach:

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
